Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis 

1. Requirement Gathering 
• Store and manage policy details (type, premium, expiry, customer). 
• Automate renewal reminders for policies. 
• Enable claim submission & approval process. 
• Provide dashboards for management (renewals, claims, agent performance). 
• Ensure data security for sensitive customer information. 

2. Stakeholder Analysis 
• Policyholders (Customers): Submit claims, receive updates, renew policies. 
• Agents: Manage policies, handle claims, follow up with customers. 
• Claims Officers: Verify documents, approve/reject claims. 
• Managers/Admins: Monitor renewals, claims, revenue, and agent performance. 

3. Business Process Mapping 
  1. Policy Creation → Agent issues a policy to a customer. 
  2. Policy Renewal → CRM checks expiry → sends reminders → agent/customer renews. 
  3. Claim Submission → Customer submits → assigned to agent → verified → approved/rejected. 
  4. Reporting → Manager views dashboards for performance & decision-making. 

4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis 
• Most insurance companies need policy lifecycle management, renewal automation, and claim processing transparency. 
• Benchmark: Companies using CRMs like Salesforce improve claim resolution time and customer retention. 
• Compliance: Sensitive customer and claim data must be secured (field-level security, encryption). 

5. AppExchange Exploration 
• Explore existing Salesforce apps that could support insurance use cases: 
      o Insurance Policy Management Apps 
      o Document Management Apps (for claims) 
      o SMS/Email Notification Apps (Twilio, SendGrid, ClickSend)
